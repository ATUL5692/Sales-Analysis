This project analyzes real-world e-commerce sales data using a combination of SQL and Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) to derive business insights such as top-selling categories, monthly trends, and city-wise revenue. It connects to a MySQL database using SQL queries to extract structured data, which is then visualized in Python through a Jupyter Notebook. Key insights include identifying top-performing product categories, high-revenue regions, and sales distribution over time. The project demonstrates effective data integration, querying, transformation, and visualization for real-time business intelligence.
